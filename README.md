# Video CDN

Video CDN is a powerful service designed to enhance the streaming experience for Twitch streamers. With Video CDN, you can easily capture videos from Twitch streams and save them on our servers. This allows you to efficiently deliver high-quality content to your viewers, functioning as a relay server for Twitch's HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) protocol.

## How it Works

Video CDN simplifies the process of capturing and distributing Twitch stream content:

1. **Capture Twitch Streams**: Video CDN enables you to select and capture specific videos from Twitch streams. This can include live streams, and past broadcasts.

2. **Server Storage**: Once captured, the videos are securely stored on our servers. This ensures that your content is readily available and can be efficiently delivered to your audience.
